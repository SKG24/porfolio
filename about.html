        <h3> WHY COMPUTER CODING AND TECHOLOGY?</h3>
        <p> My interest in human-computer relations comes from fascinating development around the world. Nowadays, it is no secret human emotions can be manipulated by technology. And, for many people, it is changing their lives for better or worse. It is more of a mutual relationship where without one, the existence of the other is left unnoticed. This inter-relation is my fasination.
